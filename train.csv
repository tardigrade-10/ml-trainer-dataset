  cause bugs by forcing views inside the table view to load and perform
  layout without accurate information (e.g. table view bounds, trait
  collection, layout margins, safe area insets, etc), and will also
  cause unnecessary performance overhead due to extra layout passes.
  Make a symbolic breakpoint at
  UITableViewAlertForLayoutOutsideViewHierarchy to catch this in the

To my understanding, the processor, not via a jump, but automatically starts executing code inside RAM at 16-bit segment:offset address 0xFFFF:0x0000. Meaning that all computers technically must have at least 1MB worth of RAM initially in order for them to be able to boot, due to the processors starting location, and due to that knowledge I have been assuming that all BIOS's automatically write themselves into RAM before the processor gets its RST signal. Which I feel is not true, as that is exactly what ""Shadow BIOS"" is which can be disabled through BIOS I believe.

I looks like the conditional call approach appears to use more of the hardware. But I found it interesting that the conditional approach only has 1 more uop (the branch over approach had 5 uops). I guess this makes sense given that under the hood the call turns into a push and jmp (and the push turns into rsp math and a memory mov). This would suggest to me that the conditional call approach is approximately equivalent (although maybe my simplistic analysis is flawed here?).,0,stackoverflow_2019

"The third scenario consists of the mixture of the previous two. Two docker-compose. The development docker-compose contains both containers, but with mechanisms that allow a live reload of the application, mapping volumes and using, for example, Spring Dev Tools. In this way, the containers are launched and, in case of any change in the files, the application container will detect that there is a change and will be relaunched. For production, a docker-compose would be created simply with both containers, but without the functionality of live reload. This would be the ideal scenario, in my opinion, but I think it is very dependent on the technologies used since not all allow live reload.",0,stackoverflow_2020

On this PIC24, each port has 16 pins, each of which has a TRIS (data direction control) register, ODC (open drain control) register, and LAT (latch) register that, if configured as an output, will need an initial value.  Conventionally, writing to one bit at a time sixteen times is discouraged in favor of writing to the entire port once.
