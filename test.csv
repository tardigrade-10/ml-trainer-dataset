The sample middleware in short checks for a bool status and if true redirects to the counter page provided by the out of the box blazor template.  Without the middleware inserted into the pipeline the counter page works just fine when you click the button, but once the middleware is placed in the pipeline the button no longer works, as it does not increment the count. I've placed the custom middleware right before the app.UseEndpoints middleware, though it appears it doesn't matter where it's placed, as it doesn't work no matter the order that it's in.  Why is my custom middleware breaking the blazor server-side page from functioning properly?",0,stackoverflow_2019

"The reason why I can't use FileSystemWatcher is it's not reliable. Sometimes I put 100x file to the folder and FileSystemWatcher only fires 20x-30x events and if it's network drive it can be lower sometimes.
My method was saving all the files and their unique ID's into a text file and check the index file every 5 second if there are any changes. If there are no big files like 18GB it's working fine.. But computing hash of 40GB file takes way too long..
My question is : How can I fire events when something happen to the folder I am watching",0,stackoverflow_2019

I have a Java program which searches for a folder with the date of yesterday and compresses it to a 7zip file and deletes it at the end. Now I have noticed that the generated 7zip archive files by my program are way too big. When I use a program like 7-Zip File Manager to compress my files it generates an archive which is 5 kb big while my program generates an archive which is 737 kb big for the same files (which have a 873 kb size). Now I am afraid that my program does not compress it to a 7zip file but do a usual zip file. Is there a way to change something in my code so that it generates a smaller 7zip file like 7-Zip File Manager would do it?,0,stackoverflow_2019
